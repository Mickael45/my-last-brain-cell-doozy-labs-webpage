    genesisSpark: "Staring into the fridge asking 'what's for dinner?' while recipes rot across 4 different apps, 2 bookmarks folders, and a napkin. That was the breaking point. I needed something centralized where I could add dishes, rate them, track my progress, and — most importantly — hook into Grocy so generating a weekly meal plan and pushing groceries is literally two clicks.",
    coreProblem: "Cooking isn't the hard part — organizing the chaos around it is. Dishes scattered across websites and note apps. No way to track what worked, what didn't, or what needs more garlic. And every week, rebuilding a grocery list from memory like some kind of culinary archaeologist.",

    genesisSpark: "Every bank has its own app, its own dashboard, its own version of 'here's your balance.' None of them talk to each other, and none of them answer the only question that matters: where is all the money going? I wanted a private, offline tool that pulls everything into one place — no cloud dependency, no handing credentials to a third party — just clean graphs showing how the money moves and what's actually expendable.",
    coreProblem: "Getting a clear picture of your finances shouldn't require trusting a third-party app with your bank credentials or maintaining a spreadsheet that dies of neglect after week two. The real problem was fragmentation and privacy — multiple accounts across multiple banks, each in their own silo, with no unified view and no way to spot patterns without doing the math yourself.",
